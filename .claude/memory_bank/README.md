# Memory Bank

This directory serves as a knowledge repository for Claude Code, similar to the `instructions/` folder but specifically for storing:

## Purpose
- **Implementation memories** - Lessons learned from previous implementations
- **Pattern libraries** - Proven code patterns and solutions
- **Decision records** - Architecture decisions and their rationale
- **Common pitfalls** - Known issues and their solutions
- **Quick reference guides** - Condensed implementation guides

## Structure
- `patterns/` - Reusable code patterns and templates
- `decisions/` - Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- `lessons/` - Lessons learned from implementations
- `references/` - Quick reference guides and checklists

## Usage
Claude should consult this directory before major implementations to:
1. Avoid repeating past mistakes
2. Reuse proven patterns
3. Maintain consistency with previous decisions
4. Apply lessons learned from previous work

## Relationship to Other Directories
- `docs/` - High-level architecture and documentation
- `instructions/` - Step-by-step implementation guides
- `examples/` - Working code samples
- `memory_bank/` - Implementation wisdom and patterns (this directory)
