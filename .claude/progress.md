## Action Log

### 🏗️ Infrastructure Setup (Completed)

**10:42 - Directory Structure Creation**
- ✅ Created `.claude/` directory
- ✅ Created `.claude/memory_bank/` with subdirectories:
  - `patterns/` - Reusable code patterns
  - `decisions/` - Architecture decision records
  - `lessons/` - Implementation lessons learned
  - `references/` - Quick reference guides
- ✅ Created README.md for memory_bank explaining purpose and structure

**10:42 - Core Documentation Setup**
- ✅ Moved `CLAUDE.md` to `.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ Created `.claude/plan.md` with comprehensive checklist-driven approach
- ✅ Created `.claude/cross_reference.md` for documentation cross-examination
- ✅ Created `.claude/activecontext.md` for current state tracking
- ✅ Created `.claude/progress.md` (this file) for action tracking

### 📋 Planning System Implementation (Completed)

**10:42 - Checklist-Driven Planning**
- ✅ Implemented pre-implementation checklist (research, architecture, feature planning)
- ✅ Implemented implementation checklist (core, UI, testing)
- ✅ Implemented cross-examination system with current docs
- ✅ Implemented quality assurance gates
- ✅ Implemented one-thing-at-a-time protocol
- ✅ Implemented emergency protocols for failures

**10:42 - Cross-Reference System**
- ✅ Mapped all architecture documents to use cases
- ✅ Mapped implementation summaries to work areas
- ✅ Mapped step-by-step guides to workflows
- ✅ Created feature type quick reference
- ✅ Created system component mapping
- ✅ Implemented conflict detection system

### 🔍 System Analysis (Completed)

**10:42 - Demo UI Review**
- ✅ Analyzed demo.py structure
- ✅ Confirmed tabbed interface working (8 tabs identified)
- ✅ Verified service layer integration
- ✅ Confirmed logging system functional
- ✅ Identified all available game systems (character, combat, items, magic, etc.)

## Workflow Established

### Before Every Action:
1. **Read activecontext.md** - Understand current state
2. **Check plan.md** - Follow checklist-driven approach
3. **Consult cross_reference.md** - Cross-examine with existing docs
4. **Review memory_bank** - Apply lessons learned

### After Every Action:
1. **Update activecontext.md** - Reflect current state
2. **Log in progress.md** - Document what was done
3. **Update memory_bank** - Capture lessons if applicable
4. **Mark todos complete** - Track progress

### For Major Changes:
1. **Pre-implementation review** - Show user the plan
2. **Code review** - Show user implementation before deployment
3. **Testing review** - Show user test results
4. **Integration review** - Show user feature working
