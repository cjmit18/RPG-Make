# Active Context - Gemini Code Assist Session State

**Last Updated:** 2025-07-17 (Current Session)
**Session Focus:** Mirroring .claude/.github folder structures for Gemini Code Assist integration

## Current Working Files
- **Primary Focus:** `.gemini/` directory setup and structure mirroring
- **Source Reference:** `.claude/` and `.github/` directory structures and contents
- **Recently Created:** All files in `.gemini/`
- **Modified Files:** None in current session (all new files)

## Active Task Context
**Current Task:** Creating Gemini Code Assist reference system structure
**Phase:** Documentation creation and structure mirroring
**Next Action:** Complete memory bank creation and settings configuration

## Gemini Code Assist Integration Status
### Documentation Status
- ðŸ”„ **GEMINI.md:** Comprehensive architecture and pattern guidelines being created
- ðŸ”„ **plan.md:** Checklist-driven development workflow being established
- ðŸ”„ **progress.md:** Session tracking and action logging being implemented
- ðŸ”„ **cross_reference.md:** Documentation cross-examination system being created
- ðŸ”„ **activecontext.md:** Currently being created
- ðŸ”„ **memory_bank/:** Directory structure being created
- ðŸ”„ **settings.json:** Gemini specific configuration being created

### Pattern Alignment
- âœ… **Service Layer:** Guidelines will ensure Gemini suggestions use service architecture
- âœ… **Factory Pattern:** Object creation patterns will be documented for Gemini reference
- âœ… **Configuration:** ConfigManager usage patterns will be established
- âœ… **UI Integration:** Demo integration patterns will be documented

## System State

- Cross-reference system helped maintain documentation consistency
- Progress tracking enabled better session continuity

### Architecture Patterns Established
- Service layer architecture documented and functional
- Factory pattern implementations working correctly
- Configuration management through ConfigManager established
- JSON-driven configuration system operational

## Gemini Code Assist Specific Context

### AI-Assisted Development State
- **Pattern Recognition:** GEMINI.md will provide pattern examples for better suggestions
- **Context Building:** Cross-reference system will help provide relevant context
- **Quality Assurance:** Checklist-driven approach will ensure suggestion quality
- **Architecture Alignment:** Guidelines will ensure suggestions follow project patterns

### Code Generation Context
- **Service Layer Focus:** Business logic isolated in service classes
- **Factory Usage:** Object creation uses established factories
- **Configuration Integration:** Features use ConfigManager for settings
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive exception handling patterns documented

### Integration Points
- **Demo Integration:** All features must work through demo.py interface
- **Testing Integration:** Service layer testing patterns established
- **Documentation Integration:** Changes update relevant documentation
- **Pattern Consistency:** New
