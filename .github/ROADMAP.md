# üó∫Ô∏è RPG Engine Development Roadmap

**Project Status:** ‚úÖ Architecture Complete
**Last Updated:** July 20, 2025

This document outlines the strategic development roadmap for the RPG Engine. With the core architecture now complete and validated, the project is in a **maintenance and enhancement phase**. This plan focuses on expanding engine capabilities, adding rich gameplay features, and creating a robust platform for content creation.

---

## Phase 1: System Enhancement & Polish

This phase focuses on maturing the existing systems and adding advanced, low-level features that build upon the stable architectural foundation.

### üß† Artificial Intelligence
*   **Advanced Behavior Trees:** Expand the `BehaviorTree` system to support more complex non-combat behaviors like patrolling, social interactions, and environmental awareness.
*   **Strategic AI:** Develop a higher-level AI "director" or `PlatoonAI` that can coordinate the actions of multiple enemies, enabling group tactics like flanking, focusing fire, and strategic retreats.
*   **Configurable AI Personalities:** Allow AI behaviors (`aggressive`, `defensive`, `opportunistic`) to be defined and assigned via character templates in JSON.

### üìñ Narrative & World Systems
*   **Quest & Dialogue Manager:** Implement a full-featured `QuestManager` and `DialogueManager`.
    *   **Quests:** Support for multi-stage quests, conditional branching, and various objective types (fetch, kill, escort).
    *   **Dialogue:** Create a system for branching conversations with state-driven responses based on player choices, quest status, or faction reputation.
*   **Faction & Reputation System:** Build a system to track player standing with various factions, influencing NPC interactions, quest availability, and shop prices.

### üõ†Ô∏è Modding & Extensibility
*   **Formalize Plugin API:** Evolve the existing hook system into a documented, formal Plugin API, allowing third parties to add significant new functionality without modifying core code.
*   **Mod Loader:** Create a `ModLoader` service that can load user-generated content (new items, characters, quests) from a dedicated `mods/` directory with a defined structure and override priority.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Core Engine Polish
*   **In-Game Profiler UI:** Develop a UI for the `Profiler` to display real-time performance metrics, helping to identify and debug bottlenecks during development and playtesting.
*   **Advanced Save/Load:** Enhance the save/load system with schema versioning and data migration capabilities to ensure saved games remain compatible across future updates.
*   **Binary Data Caching:** Implement caching for frequently accessed data (e.g., using `msgpack` or `pickle`) to reduce JSON parsing overhead and improve load times.

## Phase 2: Gameplay & Content Expansion

With the core systems enhanced, this phase is dedicated to building out the game world and the player's interaction with it.

### ‚öîÔ∏è Gameplay Mechanics
*   **Crafting System:** Implement a complete crafting system with recipes, material components, and crafting stations.
*   **Environment Interaction:** Add systems for interacting with the game world, such as puzzles, traps, and destructible environments.
*   **Stealth System:** Develop mechanics for stealth, including detection, visibility, and noise, enabling rogue-like gameplay.

### üó∫Ô∏è Content Creation
*   **New Character Content:**
    *   Add a significant number of new character templates (`character_templates.json`).
    *   Create new jobs/classes with unique skills and progression paths (`jobs.json`).
*   **Expanded Item Database:**
    *   Add hundreds of new items, including unique and legendary gear with special effects (`items.json`).
    *   Introduce item sets that provide bonuses when multiple pieces are equipped.
*   **World Building:**
    *   Design and implement multiple game zones, each with unique enemies, quests, and points of interest.
    *   Create a `WorldManager` to handle the state and persistence of these zones.

## Phase 3: Future-Proofing & Advanced Capabilities

This phase focuses on long-term features that will significantly expand the engine's potential.

### üåê Networking & Multiplayer
*   **Network-Serializable Events:** Refactor the `EventBus` and game events to be serializable for network transmission.
*   **Authoritative Server Model:** Design and implement a basic authoritative server to manage game state, laying the groundwork for co-op or multiplayer modes.

### ‚ú® Advanced Features
*   **Procedural Generation:** Develop systems for procedurally generating content like loot, dungeons, or simple side quests to enhance replayability.
*   **Advanced Animation System:** Integrate a more robust animation system that ties into the `ActionQueue` and `CombatEngine` to provide fluid, state-driven character animations.
*   **Localization Support:** Implement a system for managing and loading translated strings to support multiple languages.

## Ongoing Tasks & Maintenance

These tasks are crucial for the long-term health of the project and should be performed continuously.

### üêû Bug Fixes & Stability
*   Maintain a structured process for tracking, prioritizing, and fixing bugs.
*   Write regression tests for all fixed bugs to prevent recurrence.
*   Prioritize the stability of the core services and the event-driven architecture.

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
*   Regularly profile the engine, especially during combat and asset loading, to identify and resolve performance bottlenecks.
*   Refactor systems as needed to improve efficiency and memory usage.

### üìö Documentation
*   **Maintain High Standards:** Continue the excellent practice of documenting all new systems, features, and architectural decisions.
*   **Update `docs/` and `.github/`:** Ensure all documentation, especially `COPILOT.md` and the `memory_bank`, is kept current with new patterns and lessons learned.
*   **API Documentation:** Generate and maintain API documentation for the service and plugin layers.

### ‚úÖ Testing
*   **Expand Test Coverage:** Ensure all new features and services have comprehensive unit and integration tests.
*   **Automate UI Testing:** Develop automated tests for the UI to catch regressions in the `demo.py` application.
*   **Stress Testing:** Create scenarios to test the engine's stability and performance under heavy load (e.g., many actors, rapid events).
