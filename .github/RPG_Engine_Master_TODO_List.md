# üîß RPG Engine Master To-Do List - Updated July 2025

## ‚úÖ Completed / Implemented

### **Core Engine Systems**
- [x] StatManager system with traditional RPG stats
- [x] Equipment system with dual-equip/offhand logic
- [x] Enchantments and scaling refactor using ScalingManager
- [x] Skill loading and registration system
- [x] Weakness/Resistance integration with elemental damage
- [x] Combo system (bar, tab, tracking, real-time updates)
- [x] Rendering system scaffold (2D/3D hybrid)
- [x] Config system (JSON-driven settings and game data)
- [x] Comprehensive UI with tabbed interface
- [x] Passive effects using event hooks
- [x] Job system with starter gear and block chance from shields
- [x] Damage pipeline: Physical, Magic, AoE logic with calculations
- [x] SimpleGameDemo integration with full feature showcase
- [x] Inventory system with equip/remove/use functionality
- [x] Character creation with templates and progression
- [x] Combat system with AI integration
- [x] Magic system with spells and enchantments
- [x] Save/Load functionality with JSON serialization

### **ÔøΩÔ∏è Architecture Modernization (July 2025) - COMPLETE**
- [x] **Service Layer Architecture**: Business logic separation from UI
- [x] **Controller Pattern**: Game logic wrapped in interface-compliant classes
- [x] **Factory Pattern**: Registry-based object creation (Character, Item, Effect)
- [x] **Interface Design**: Type-safe contracts with Protocol classes
- [x] **Configuration Management**: Thread-safe singleton with JSON-driven config
- [x] **Event-Driven Updates**: Observer pattern integration for UI automation
- [x] **UI Service Delegation**: Clean presentation layer with selective delegation
- [x] **Hook System Integration**: Extensible event-driven architecture
- [x] **Error Handling**: Centralized error management and user feedback

### **ÔøΩ Quality Assurance Achievements**
- [x] **Code Organization**: Logical module structure with clear dependencies
- [x] **Type Safety**: Comprehensive interface coverage with mypy compatibility
- [x] **Documentation**: Organized documentation structure with clear navigation
- [x] **Testing Framework**: Integration tests and validation scripts
- [x] **UI Consolidation**: Removed duplicate UI systems and redundant code
- [x] **Backwards Compatibility**: Fallback systems maintain existing functionality

## üîú In Progress / Next Development Phase
- [ ] ActionQueue system (initiative, delay, reactions)
- [ ] TimeManager (tick system, global time management)  
- [ ] Unified EventBus (pre/post hooks, async-safe operations)
- [ ] HookDispatcher expansion and refactor
- [ ] Profiler/Runtime Debugging Tool for performance monitoring
- [ ] Character module refactor (Actor/Stats system overhaul)

## üß† Tier 1: Core Systems Expansion
- [ ] EffectStack system (layered buffs/debuffs with stacking rules)
- [ ] Combat tagging system (track damage sources, kill attribution)
- [ ] ModeManager (CombatModes: idle, aggressive, defensive states)
- [ ] ScalingManager full integration (items, skills, enchantments)
- [ ] Enhanced Save/Load with schema validation and migration
- [ ] ResourceManager (asset indexing, caching, async loading)
- [ ] TurnManager or InitiativeQueue for strategic combat
- [ ] Runtime Config API (dynamic settings without restart)

## üß© Tier 2: Feature Expansion  
- [ ] AIManager (modular behavior states and decision trees)
- [ ] Advanced scripting for item/NPC logic and interactions
- [ ] QuestManager (progress tracking, rewards, journal entries)
- [ ] DialogueManager (branching conversations with state)
- [ ] WorldManager (zones, regions, persistent world state)
- [ ] EnvironmentManager (weather, lighting, ambient effects)
- [ ] Modding API (scripting engine for user content)

## üß™ Testing and Development Tools
- [ ] Comprehensive smoke test coverage for all core modules
- [ ] Mod loader with folder override priority system
- [ ] Scriptable encounters and procedural missions
- [ ] Binary data caching (msgpack/pickle optimization)
- [ ] In-game profiler viewer and performance analytics
- [ ] Automated integration testing for major workflows

## üí° Advanced Features / Future Development
- [ ] Networking hooks and multiplayer foundation
- [ ] Procedural content generation (missions, loot, encounters)  
- [ ] Animation system with ActionResolver integration
- [ ] Advanced UI layering and HUD management system
- [ ] Sophisticated AI targeting logic and tactical decisions
- [ ] Plugin architecture for third-party integrations
