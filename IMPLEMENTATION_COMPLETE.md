# 🎮 RPG Engine v2.0 - Implementation Complete!

## 🎯 **Mission Accomplished**

We have successfully created a **new async-first RPG engine** from scratch with an **interactive UI** as the priority. The implementation demonstrates modern software architecture patterns and provides a solid foundation for future game development.

## 🏗️ **What We Built**

### **1. Async-First Core Architecture**
- ✅ **`AsyncGameEngine`** - Main orchestrator with async game loop
- ✅ **`ServiceContainer`** - Dependency injection with lifecycle management  
- ✅ **`EventBus`** - Strongly-typed event system with middleware support
- ✅ **Comprehensive logging and error handling**

### **2. Interactive UI System**
- ✅ **Real-time engine controls** (Start, Stop, Pause, Resume)
- ✅ **Live status monitoring** (FPS, frame count, uptime, events)
- ✅ **Event system testing** (Publish and monitor events)
- ✅ **Service container inspection** (View registered services)
- ✅ **Performance testing tools** (Event throughput, statistics)

### **3. Event-Driven Architecture**
- ✅ **Strongly-typed events** with dataclasses
- ✅ **Middleware support** (Logging, validation)
- ✅ **Async event handling** with concurrent processing
- ✅ **Event history and statistics**

### **4. Service-Oriented Design**
- ✅ **Dependency injection container**
- ✅ **Async service initialization**
- ✅ **Service lifecycle management**
- ✅ **Protocol-based interfaces**

## 🚀 **Demo Applications**

### **1. Basic Test (`test_engine.py`)**
```bash
python test_engine.py
```
- Unit tests for core components
- Service container verification
- Event bus functionality
- Engine lifecycle testing

### **2. Simple UI Test (`simple_ui_test.py`)**
```bash
python simple_ui_test.py
```
- Basic interactive UI
- Engine control buttons
- Real-time logging
- Simple event testing

### **3. Comprehensive Demo (`engine_demo.py`)**
```bash
python engine_demo.py
```
- **Full-featured UI** with professional styling
- **Complete engine controls** with visual feedback
- **Real-time statistics** and monitoring
- **Interactive demos** (Event testing, performance tests)
- **Game simulation** capabilities
- **Statistics export** functionality
