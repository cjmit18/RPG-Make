# Enemy Stat Scaling Implementation Documentation

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive overview of the enemy stat scaling system, focusing on how enemy strength is calculated, boosted, and displayed in the UI.

## Key Components

### 1. Configuration-Driven Multiplier
The strength boost multiplier is defined in the config system at `constants.combat.strength_multiplier`:

```json
{
  "constants": {
    "combat": {
      "strength_multiplier": 200
    }
  }
}
```

This value can be adjusted to change how much additional strength enemies gain based on their level, grade, and rarity.

### 2. Backend Scaling Logic
The core scaling logic is implemented in `ScalingManager.apply_enemy_stat_boost()` in `game_sys/core/scaling_manager.py`:

- Retrieves the strength multiplier from config
- Calculates grade and rarity multipliers based on enemy attributes
- Computes the final strength boost using: `level * multiplier * strength_boost_mult`
- Applies the boost to the enemy's `base_stats` dictionary
- Logs the boost application for debugging

### 3. UI Display
The UI display is handled in `update_enemy_info()` in `demo.py`:

- Displays enemy information including level, grade, and rarity
- Shows BASE STATS section with stats from `enemy.base_stats` dictionary
- Shows COMBAT STATS section with derived stats from `enemy.get_stat()`
- Ensures strength and other stats are accurately displayed from the correct data structure

## Testing and Verification

Multiple test scripts were created to verify the implementation:
- `test_enemy_strength.py` - Tests backend strength calculation
- `test_enemy_boost.py` - Tests boost application logic
- `test_ui_strength_display.py` - Tests UI display accuracy
- `final_verification.py` - Final verification guide

## Implementation Details

1. **Base Stat Storage**:
   - All enemy stats are stored in the `base_stats` dictionary attribute
   - Boosted values are applied directly to this dictionary

2. **Stat Calculation Flow**:
   1. Enemy is created (via template or random generation)
   2. `ScalingManager.apply_enemy_stat_boost()` is called
   3. The boost is calculated using config-driven multipliers
   4. Boost is applied to the `base_stats` dictionary
   5. UI reads from the `base_stats` dictionary for display

3. **Debugging Information**:
   - Detailed logging at debug level in `scaling_manager.py`
   - Values are logged at key points in the calculation process

## Manual Verification Steps

To verify the system is working correctly:

1. Run `demo.py`
2. Click "Spawn Enemy" to create a random enemy
3. Check the "Enemy Info" panel
4. Verify the strength value in BASE STATS matches the expected boosted value
5. The Attack value in COMBAT STATS should be derived from the boosted strength

## Conclusion

The enemy stat scaling system is now fully configurable and properly displayed in the UI. All scaling is driven by the configuration system rather than hardcoded values, making it flexible and maintainable.
