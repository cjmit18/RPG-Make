## Expanded Stats Display - Implementation Summary

### Changes Made

#### 1. Enhanced UI Service (ui/demo_ui.py)
**File:** `ui/demo_ui.py` 
**Method:** `update_character_display()`

**BEFORE:** Only showed basic RPG stats (strength, dexterity, etc.) with limited meta filtering
**AFTER:** Now shows comprehensive stats organized in categories:

- **Core Attributes**: strength, dexterity, intelligence, wisdom, constitution, charisma, vitality, agility, willpower, perception, luck, focus
- **Combat Stats**: accuracy, critical_chance, critical_multiplier, attack_speed, defense, magic_defense, dodge_chance, parry_chance, block_chance  
- **Derived Stats**: max_health, max_mana, max_stamina, health_regen, mana_regen, stamina_regen, magic_power, initiative, movement_speed, carrying_capacity
- **Additional Stats**: Any other stats from base_stats that weren't covered above

#### 2. Enhanced Main Demo Character Display (demo.py)
**File:** `demo.py`
**Method:** `_get_core_stats()`

**BEFORE:** Only showed priority stats (strength, dexterity, vitality, intelligence, wisdom, constitution) plus some filtered additional stats
**AFTER:** Shows comprehensive stats in organized categories using the same structure as the UI service

#### 3. Enhanced Leveling Tab Display (demo.py)  
**File:** `demo.py`
**Method:** `update_leveling_display()`

**BEFORE:** Only showed basic RPG stats (strength, dexterity, vitality, intelligence, wisdom, constitution, luck, agility)
**AFTER:** Shows the same comprehensive categorized stats as the character display:

- Core Attributes section
- Combat Stats section  
- Derived Stats section
- Additional Stats section for any uncategorized stats

### Features Added

#### Smart Stat Resolution
- Checks `player.get_stat(stat_name)` first for effective/calculated values
- Falls back to `player.base_stats[stat_name]` for base values
- Falls back to direct attributes `getattr(player, stat_name)` as last resort
- Gracefully handles missing stats by continuing to next one

#### Proper Formatting
- **Percentage stats**: critical_chance, dodge_chance, etc. shown as percentages (e.g., "6.0%")
- **Regular stats**: shown with 2 decimal places (e.g., "12.00")
- **Base → Effective**: When base value differs from effective value, shows both (e.g., "10 → 15")

#### Organized Categories
Stats are now logically grouped instead of just listed alphabetically:
1. **Core Attributes** - Primary character attributes that define the character
2. **Combat Stats** - Stats directly related to combat effectiveness  
3. **Derived Stats** - Calculated stats that depend on core attributes
4. **Additional Stats** - Any other stats found in base_stats

### Testing
- ✅ Created test script `test_expanded_stats.py`
- ✅ Verified player has 14+ base stats (up from ~8 before)
- ✅ Confirmed `get_stat()` method works for effective values
- ✅ Confirmed demo starts successfully with expanded display

### User Experience Improvements

#### Character Stats Tab
- Much more comprehensive stat display
- Clear organization into logical categories
- Shows both base and effective values when they differ
- Better understanding of character capabilities

#### Leveling Tab
- Same comprehensive stats as Character tab
- Easier to see what stats are affected by equipment/effects
- Better visibility into character progression
- All allocatable and non-allocatable stats visible

#### Equipment Integration
- When equipment is equipped (like Ring of Power), users can easily see:
  - Which stats are boosted
  - By how much (base → effective display)
  - Total effective values for planning

### Next Steps for Users
1. **Test Ring of Power**: Create ring_of_power in Inventory tab, equip it, see stat bonuses
2. **Compare before/after**: Look at Character Stats before and after equipping items
3. **Check Leveling**: See how stat allocation affects effective values
4. **Equipment planning**: Use expanded stats to plan optimal equipment loadouts

The expanded stats display provides a much more complete picture of character capabilities and makes it easier to understand the impact of equipment, effects, and stat allocation choices.
