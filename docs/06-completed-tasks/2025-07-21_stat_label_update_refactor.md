# Stat Label Update Refactor - Implementation Summary (July 21, 2025)

## Summary
Refactored the character creation demo's stat label update logic to robustly handle missing or malformed stat data, ensure correct display of reduced stats and allocatable stat points, and improve error handling and formatting.

## Key Changes
- File: `newdemo.py`
- Method: `_update_stat_labels`
- Added checks for `stat_data` presence and type before updating UI.
- Combined `base_*` and `allocated_*` values for each stat if available.
- Consistent formatting: 1 decimal for floats, int otherwise.
- Allocatable stat points now always reflect the true value, using both `stat_data` and character attribute fallback.
- UI update only occurs if data is valid and UI service is present.
- Comprehensive error logging for all failure cases.

## Motivation
- Prevent runtime errors when stat data is missing or not yet initialized.
- Ensure the UI always displays accurate, user-friendly stat and point values.
- Align with service-oriented and robust UI update patterns described in project architecture docs.

## Related Documentation
- See `.github/memory_bank/2025-07-21_stat_label_update_refactor.md` for detailed rationale and lessons learned.
- See `docs/CHARACTER_LIBRARY_GUIDE.md` for character stat and UI integration patterns.

## Next Steps
- Add integration tests for stat allocation and display.
- Consider moving stat label formatting to the service layer for further decoupling.
- Update implementation guides with this robust UI update pattern.
