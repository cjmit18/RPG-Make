# Charisma Implementation Summary

## Changes Made to Implement Charisma as an Allocatable Stat

### 1. Character Templates (`game_sys/character/data/character_templates.json`)
- Added `"charisma"` stat to all character templates with appropriate base values
- Hero: 10, Mage: 9, Warrior: 8, Goblin: 2, Orc: 3, Dragon: 16, Skeleton: 1, Wolf: 4, Rogue: 11

### 2. Leveling Manager (`game_sys/character/leveling_manager.py`)
- Added `'charisma'` to `allocatable_stats` list
- Added charisma description: "Enhances negotiation, leadership, and social interactions"
- Added charisma stat impacts:
  - `leadership`: 0.02 per point
  - `social_influence`: 0.05 per point
  - `negotiation_bonus`: 0.01 per point

### 3. Configuration (`game_sys/config/default_settings.json`)
- Added `"charisma_multiplier": 1.2` to combat constants
- Added charisma-derived stats to derived_stats:
  - `leadership`: 1.0
  - `social_influence`: 0.5
  - `negotiation_bonus`: 0.02
- Added `"charisma": 0.0` to stats_defaults

### 4. Scaling Manager (`game_sys/core/scaling_manager.py`)
- Added charisma to `base_rpg_stats` list
- Added charisma multiplier retrieval and validation
- Added charisma boost calculation for enemy scaling
- Added charisma-derived stat mappings:
  - `leadership` → `charisma`
  - `social_influence` → `charisma`
  - `negotiation_bonus` → `charisma`

### 5. Character Info Service (`game_sys/character/character_info_service.py`)
- Added `'charisma'` to primary stats collection
- Added `'charisma_bonus'` to item stat attributes
- Added charisma display with ✨ emoji
- Updated display formatting to handle odd number of stats

### 6. UI Character Creation (`ui/character_creation_ui.py`)
- Added `("Charisma", "charisma")` to stat allocation buttons
- Added `'charisma': '✨'` to stat emoji mapping
- Charisma already included in secondary stats display

## New Derived Stats Added
1. **Leadership**: Affects group dynamics and party bonuses
2. **Social Influence**: Affects NPC interactions and reputation
3. **Negotiation Bonus**: Affects trading and dialogue outcomes

## Testing
- Created comprehensive test script (`test_charisma_implementation.py`)
- All tests pass successfully:
  ✅ Charisma in allocatable stats
  ✅ Stat description and impacts
  ✅ Config values loaded correctly
  ✅ Character creation with charisma
  ✅ Stat allocation works
  ✅ Derived stats calculated correctly

## Usage in Game
- Players can now allocate stat points to charisma during character creation
- Charisma affects social interactions through derived stats
- Item bonuses can include charisma_bonus
- Enemy scaling includes charisma in stat boosts
- Character info displays show charisma with other primary stats

Charisma is now fully implemented as a core allocatable stat in the RPG system!
