# Config Refactoring Summary (Phase 2)

This document summarizes the changes made to move hardcoded game configuration out of demo.py and into JSON configuration files.

## Changes Made

1. Updated `item_properties.json` to use uppercase values for rarities and grades to match `default_settings.json`:
   - Changed item grades from lowercase ("poor", "normal", etc.) to uppercase ("ONE", "TWO", etc.)
   - Changed item rarities from lowercase ("common", "uncommon", etc.) to uppercase ("COMMON", "UNCOMMON", etc.)
   - Added missing grades "SIX" and "SEVEN"
   - Added missing rarity "DIVINE"

2. Updated `damage_types.json` to use uppercase values for damage types to match `default_settings.json`:
   - Changed damage types from lowercase ("physical", "fire", etc.) to uppercase ("PHYSICAL", "FIRE", etc.)
   - Added missing damage types "NONE", "DARK", and "MAGIC"

3. Updated `damage_type_utils.py` to properly handle the uppercase damage type names:
   - Modified `get_damage_type_properties()` to look for uppercase damage type names

4. Modified `demo.py` to use damage type utilities instead of direct enum references:
   - Updated all instances of direct DamageType enum access to use the `get_damage_type_by_name()` utility function
   - Added missing imports for `get_damage_type_by_name()`
   - Replaced hardcoded goblin weaknesses with config-driven damage types:
   
     ```python
     # Before
     self.enemy.weaknesses[DamageType.FIRE] = 0.40
     
     # After
     fire_type = get_damage_type_by_name("FIRE")
     self.enemy.weaknesses[fire_type] = 0.40
     ```

5. Fixed a bug in the Lightning Bolt spell in `spells.json`:
   - Added missing `tick_damage` parameter to the stun effect

## Test Results

The following tests have been verified to pass after the refactoring:

1. `test_json_system.py`:
   - Resistances and Weaknesses: PASSED
   - Loot Tables: PASSED
   - Requirements: FAILED (unrelated issue with item IDs not found in item data)

2. `test_loot_system.py`:
   - All tests passing, confirming that grades and rarities are correctly loaded from configuration
   - Grade and rarity distributions correctly applied from config settings

## Notes

- The game now uses consistent uppercase identifiers for grades, rarities, and damage types throughout the configuration files.
- The `PropertyLoader` class is already set up to load these values from configuration.
- All hardcoded references to grades, rarities, and damage types have been removed from the main game logic.

## Remaining Issues

1. Some missing item IDs in the item data files (potion_stamina, fire_staff, etc.) causing warnings
2. Requirements test in test_json_system.py failing with "argument of type 'Spell' is not iterable" error

## Next Steps

- Consider adding more comprehensive documentation for the configuration system.
- Fix the missing item IDs in the item data files.
- Investigate and fix the issue in the Requirements test.
