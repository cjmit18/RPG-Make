# Configuration System Update

The game's configuration system has been updated to use a single consolidated configuration file for better maintainability and clarity.

## Key Changes

1. **Consolidated Configuration**
   - All game settings now reside in `default_settings.json`
   - Previously separate `game_settings.json` has been merged into `default_settings.json`
   - No game-specific settings were lost in the consolidation

2. **Configuration Manager Improvements**
   - Added `get_section()` method to ConfigManager for easier access to configuration sections
   - Enhanced backward compatibility to ensure smooth transition
   - ConfigManager now handles potential missing files gracefully

3. **Benefits**
   - Simpler configuration management (one file instead of two)
   - Clearer organization with all settings in one place
   - Better validation with an updated JSON schema
   - Easier to maintain and extend

## Usage Examples

Access a configuration value:
```python
from game_sys.config.config_manager import ConfigManager

cfg = ConfigManager()
max_level = cfg.get('constants.leveling.max_level')
```

Access an entire configuration section:
```python
# Get all available spells
spells = cfg.get_section('spells')

# Get all available skills
skills = cfg.get_section('skills')
```

## File Structure

The configuration system now uses these files:
- `default_settings.json`: Main configuration file with all settings
- `settings.json`: Optional user-specific overrides

For more detailed information, see the full documentation in `docs/CONFIG_SYSTEM_README.md`.
