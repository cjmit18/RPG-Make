# Resistance/Weakness System Fix Summary

## Issue Identified
The resistance/weakness system was not working because:

1. **Character Factory Bug**: In `character_factory.py`, the resistance/weakness values were being divided by 100, converting 0.25 (25%) to 0.0025 (0.25%), making them practically ineffective.

2. **Spell Casting Bug**: In `cast_manager.py`, the `take_damage` call was not passing the spell's damage type, so resistances/weaknesses were never applied during spell casting.

## Fixes Applied

### Fix 1: Character Factory (game_sys/character/character_factory.py)
**Lines 123-149**: Removed the incorrect division by 100 for resistance/weakness values.

**Before:**
```python
actor.weaknesses[damage_type] = weakness_value / 100.0
actor.resistances[damage_type] = resistance_value / 100.0
```

**After:**
```python
actor.weaknesses[damage_type] = weakness_value
actor.resistances[damage_type] = resistance_value
```

### Fix 2: Spell Cast Manager (game_sys/magic/cast_manager.py)
**Lines 88-93**: Added damage type parameter to the `take_damage` call during spell casting.

**Before:**
```python
target.take_damage(damage)
```

**After:**
```python
damage_type = getattr(spell, 'damage_type', None)
target.take_damage(damage, caster, damage_type)
```

## Verification Results
The fixes were tested with the following results:

1. **Fireball vs Orc (25% fire weakness)**: 
   - Base damage: ~56
   - Actual damage: 70.47 (25% increase ✅)

2. **Ice Shard vs Orc (no ice weakness)**:
   - Expected damage: ~22-25
   - Actual damage: 26.38 (normal damage ✅)

## Current Status
✅ **RESOLVED**: The resistance/weakness system now works correctly for both AI and non-AI controlled enemies across all damage types (weapon attacks and spells).

## Files Modified
- `game_sys/character/character_factory.py` - Fixed resistance/weakness value handling
- `game_sys/magic/cast_manager.py` - Fixed spell damage type passing
- `test_spell_resistance.py` - Created test script to verify functionality
