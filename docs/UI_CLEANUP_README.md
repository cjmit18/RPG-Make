# UI System Cleanup and Logging Integration

## Summary of Changes

The codebase has been cleaned up and improved by:

1. **Removing Unnecessary Files**
   - Debug files (debug_ui.py, debug_modular_ui.py, etc.)
   - Redundant UI demo files (simplest_ui_demo.py, advanced_ui_demo.py, etc.)

2. **Integrating the Logging System**
   - The existing logging system from the logs/ folder has been integrated throughout
   - UI components now use proper logging with appropriate levels
   - Error handling has been improved with better logging

3. **Creating Simplified Demos**
   - `simple_game_demo.py` - A basic demo that works reliably with the current engine
   - `unified_game_demo.py` - A comprehensive demo that showcases all systems

4. **Updating Documentation**
   - Main README.md updated to reflect new features and structure
   - DEMO_README.md added for demo-specific documentation

## How to Run

To run the demo, use:

```bash
python simple_game_demo.py
```

## Architecture

The UI system now follows a clean architecture:

- **UI Module**: Base widgets, layouts, themes and animations
- **Rendering Module**: Rendering pipeline and drawing operations
- **Logging Integration**: Consistent logging throughout all components

## Dependencies

Required dependencies have been added to requirements.txt:
- watchdog>=3.0.0 (needed for config file watching)

## Future Improvements

Areas for future enhancement:
- Further refine the UI component abstractions
- Create more comprehensive documentation
- Add more visual styles and animations
- Expand game system integration
