# Enchanting System Fix Summary

## Issue
The enchanting system was failing with an error when trying to apply enchantments:

```
[    INFO] simple_demo:334 | Selected item: Iron Sword (weapon)
[    INFO] simple_demo:334 | Selected enchantment: fire_enchant
[ WARNING] game_sys.items:33 | Item ID 'fire_enchant' not found in item data
[   ERROR] game_sys.items.item_loader:32 | Exception in load_item: NullItem.__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'item_id'
```

## Root Cause
The issue was occurring because:

1. The enchanting system's `apply_enchantment` method tries to load enchantments as items using `load_item(enchant_id)`.
2. Since 'fire_enchant' isn't a valid item ID, the item factory returns a NullItem.
3. However, the `NullItem` class wasn't registered in the item registry with the 'null' type ID.
4. When `ItemRegistry.get('null')` was called, it returned the NullItem class but it wasn't properly registered.

## Solution
We fixed the issue by:

1. Registering the `NullItem` class with the 'null' type ID in the item registry:
   ```python
   ItemRegistry.register('null', NullItem)
   ```

## Testing
We created a test script that verifies:
1. Loading non-existent items now returns a proper NullItem without errors
2. The enchanting system can now learn and apply enchantments without errors

## Fallback Enchanting Logic
The demo already includes a fallback enchanting logic that bypasses the enchanting system's `apply_enchantment` method:
- It directly adds the enchantment ID to the item's `enchantments` list
- It updates the item name to include the enchantment
- It doesn't try to load the enchantment as an item

## User Experience
With these changes, users can now:
- Select enchantments and items using the button-based selection approach
- Apply enchantments without seeing errors
- See their enchanted items with updated names (e.g., "Iron Sword [fire_enchant]")
